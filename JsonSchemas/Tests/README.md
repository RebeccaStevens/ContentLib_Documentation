This folder contains files set up to test the JSON schemas.

They should be valid CL scripts, except the contents of the `PurposelyFailing` folder.

Note that they use relative path syntax (ex. `./../CL_VisualKit.json`) to reference the schemas -
this is so they work locally on my machine while I'm updating them.
You will want to use the github raw path links instead (ex. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_VisualKit.json`)
