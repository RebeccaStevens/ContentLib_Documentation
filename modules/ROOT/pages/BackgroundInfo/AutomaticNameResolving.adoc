= Automatic Name Resolving

In an effort to cut down on the verbosity required when writing ContentLib files,
many fields will try to automatically resolve shortenings into their full version.

For example, you can use the name `Desc_Coal` to refer to the Coal item,
in place of the fully qualified asset path
`/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/RawResources/Coal/Desc_Coal`.

Items are resolved by comparing the supplied Item name against existing Item ClassNames in the game.
The first match the mod finds will be used, regardless of class type.

Watch out for ambiguity with Class Names!
Sometimes different assets can have very similar names.
Be as specific as possible with the name to avoid problems with this.
You can check the output logs,
or look at the content in xref:Tutorials/ContentInspector.adoc[ContentInspector]
to find out what class a path actually resolved to after ContentLib loads it.

== Finding Names

See the xref:Tutorials/FindAssetPath.adoc[Finding Assets] page
to learn how to find the names of content, and the full path of an asset if needed.

== Class Name Prefixes and Suffixes

=== Prefix

It is highly suggested that you still include the prefixes,
such as `Build_`, in order to distinguish between assets that otherwise all match the query.

For example, the shorthand "ConstructorMk1" would match the following assets:

- The FGBuildableManufacturer `/Game/FactoryGame/Buildable/Factory/ConstructorMk1/Build_ConstructorMk1`
- The FGBuildingDescriptor `/Game/FactoryGame/Buildable/Factory/ConstructorMk1/Desc_ConstructorMk1`
- The FGRecipe `/Game/FactoryGame/Buildable/Factory/ConstructorMk1/Recipe_ConstructorMk1`
- The FGDecorationTemplate `/Game/FactoryGame/Buildable/Factory/ConstructorMk1/Deco_ConstructorMk1`

// Backslash to stop indented list handling
\... but the only one you care about is `Desc_ConstructorMk1`.

In this cause, you _must_ include the prefix in order to specify which of these assets you're referring to.

=== Suffix

Class Names have a `+_C+` suffix when they have been generated by a Blueprint.
The `+_C+` suffix is optional most of the time due to the 
The exceptions to this are xref:Features/VisualKits.adoc[Visual Kits],
which need the suffix,
and xref:Features/Patching.adoc[Patch target lines],
which must be the full path.

When referencing a descriptor's Visual Kit, you must keep the `+_C+` suffix.
For example, `Desc_OreGold_C` resolves to the Caterium Ore kit,
but `Desc_OreGold` resolves to the DefaultItemMesh (default fallback).

If the asset you are patching was blueprint generated, it needs the `+_C+`.
Script-generated assets may or may not need the suffix (untested).

For example, the line at the top of the file patching the Turbofuel recipe must be
`//Game/FactoryGame/Recipes/AlternateRecipes/Parts/Recipe_Alternate_Turbofuel.Recipe_Alternate_Turbofuel_C`
