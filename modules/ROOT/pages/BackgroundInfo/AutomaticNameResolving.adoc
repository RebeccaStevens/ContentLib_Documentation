= Automatic Name Resolving

Items are resolved by comparing the supplied Item name against existing Item ClassNames in the game. The first match the mod finds will be used.

Watch out for ambiguity with Class Names! Sometimes items can have very similar names. Be as specific as possible with the name to avoid problems with this.

Class Names have a '_C' suffix when they have been generated by a Blueprint. The "_C" suffix, as well as the naming-convention related "Build" or "Desc" prefix, is optional for this mod.
