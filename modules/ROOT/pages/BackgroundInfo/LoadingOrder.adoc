= Content Loading Order

TODO

As of 0.2.0, all ContentLib content is now processed in the order:

1. Vanilla
2. Non-ContentLib mods
3. ContentLib Mods, alphabetically by mod reference (the same order SML seems to use to load mods)
4. `/Configs/ContentLib` folder contents (user overrides).

This means that Configs folder overrides will always take precedence over anything else, as they should.
