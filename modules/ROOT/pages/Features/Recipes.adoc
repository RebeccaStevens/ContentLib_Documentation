= Recipes

[NOTE]
====
You can find a xref:Reference/JsonSchema.adoc[JSON Schema] for Recipes https://github.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/tree/main/JsonSchemas[here].

[TIP]
====
Consider checking out the xref:Tutorials/CreateRecipe.adoc[Create a Recipe Tutorial] after reading this page.

In Satisfactory, recipes represent the required ingredients for
producing something manually at the workbench,
automatically in a machine like a Constructor or Blender,
or for buildings with the Build Gun.

== Requirements

- All Recipe JSON files must start with the prefix `Recipe_`
- Remember that custom Recipes need to go in the correct xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[Folder].
- Recipes must be unlocked by some schematic to be usable in game
- Recipes should have at least one producer (`ProducedIn`) specified to be useful

== Notable Features

Be sure to check out the tooltips of fields in the https://github.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/tree/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Recipe.json[recipe json schema] to learn about what options are available.

Recipes auto-generate the categories used in the `CategoryOverride` field for you if you specify one that doesn't exist.
Auto-generated Category assets have their asset name (not the in-game name) start with `Cat_` for consistency with the base game, and for identification purposes.

You can attempt to hot reload Recipes via the button on the Mod Configuration screen, or the `/CLRecipeReload` chat command.
Hot reloading is an experimental feature and it may not work properly.

== Building Recipes

The syntax for building recipes is exactly the same as crafting components.
Just remember that your recipe should have only one Product item,
the descriptor of the buildable,
and that ProducedIn should be `BP_BuildGun`.

== Examples

=== Simple Recipe

Below is an example recipe and a screenshot of it within the Item Codex in game.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Recipe.json",
    "Name": "ContentLib BioFuel",
    "Ingredients": [
        {
            "Item": "Desc_Coal",
            "Amount": 1
        }
    ],
    "Products": [
        {
            "Item": "Desc_Biofuel",
            "Amount": 10
        }
    ],
    "ManufacturingDuration": 1,
    "ProducedIn": [
        "Build_ConstructorMk1"
    ],
    "UnlockedBy": [
        "Schematic_1-1"
    ]
}
```

=== Complex Recipe

Here's an example recipe for the Blender made by McGalleon.

```json
