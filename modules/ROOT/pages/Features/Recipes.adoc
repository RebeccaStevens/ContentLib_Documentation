= Recipes

[NOTE]
====
You can find a WIP xref:Reference/JsonSchema.adoc[JSON Schema] for Recipes https://github.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/tree/main/JsonSchemas[here].
====

All Recipe JSON files must start with the prefix `Recipe_`

xref:Tutorials/CreateRecipe.adoc[Create a Recipe Tutorial]

Recipes auto-generate the categories used in the `CategoryOverride` field for you if you specify one that doesn't exist

Auto-generated Category assets have their asset name (not the in-game name) start with `Cat_` for consistency with the base game, and identification.

You can attempt to hot reload Recipes via the button on the Mod Configuration screen, or the `/CLRecipeReload` chat command. Hot reloading is a WIP feature.
