In Satisfactory, schematics are used to represent unlockables in the HUB (milestones), MAM (research nodes), AWESOME Shop (both one-time and repeatable purchases), and hard drive scans.

== Requirements

- All Schematic JSON files must start with the prefix `Schematic_`.
You may find it beneficial to add further detail in the prefix, such as `Schematic_HUB_` for HUB milestones and `Schematic_Node_` for MAM Nodes.
- Remember that custom Schematics need to go in the correct xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[Folder].
- The `Type` field determines where the schematic will be available for purchase.
  - Note that custom MAM nodes require custom Research Trees to be established as well. ContentLib research tree support exists but is undocumented and has not been tested for a long time.
- AWESOME Shop Schematics without Categories are invisible unless searched for (read more in 'Notable Features')

== Notable Features

Be sure to check out the tooltips of fields in the https://github.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/tree/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Schematic.json[schematic json schema] to learn about what options are available.

To specify schematic icons, use xref:Features/VisualKits.adoc[Visual Kits].

Schematics auto-generate the categories used in the `Category` and `SubCategories` field for you if you specify one that doesn't exist.
Auto-generated Category assets have their asset name (not the in-game name) start with `Cat_` for consistency with the base game, and for identification purposes.

// cspell:ignore CLSchemReload
You can attempt to hot reload Schematics via the button on the Mod Configuration screen, or the `/CLSchemReload` chat command.
Hot reloading is an experimental feature and it may not work properly.

Due to a base-game bug/feature, schematics and items without assigned categories are usually not displayed in menus unless they are explicitly searched for.
You can use this behavior to hide schematics from display.

== Examples

Here is an example schematic from the RePan Oil mod: 

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Schematic.json",
  "Name": "RePan Acid Process",
  "Type": "Milestone",
  "Tier": 8,
  "VisualKit": "Kit_Aciding",
  "Category": "RePan-Oil",
  "Cost": [
    {
      "Item": "Desc_AluminumPlate",
      "Amount": 100
    },
    {
      "Item": "Desc_PackagedNitrogenGas",
      "Amount": 100
    },
    {
      "Item": "Desc_PackagedSulfuricAcid",
      "Amount": 100
    }
  ],
  "Recipes": [ "Recipe_CatalyticNitricAcid", "Recipe_PickledSteelIngots", "Recipe_PickledSteelBeam", "Recipe_BlowMoldedTank", "Recipe_EtchedBoards", "Recipe_ReprocessedUranium", "Recipe_UREXCells" ]
