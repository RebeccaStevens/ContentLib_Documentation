= Content Default Object Modification

[NOTE]
====
You can find a WIP xref:Reference/JsonSchema.adoc[JSON Schema] for CDOs https://github.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/tree/main/JsonSchemas[here].
====

You can also use ContentLib to perform (Class Default Object) CDO edits.

To learn more about what a CDO is, see xref:https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/UnrealArchitecture/Objects/[this] Unreal Engine documentation page.

This is an advanced feature that can modify pretty much any field on any asset, as long as you know where the asset is and what field to look for. It can also do things like change the parent classes of blueprint assets.

In order to find the names of fields, you probably will need to either have a set up modding project, and/or look at the C++ headers shipped with the game. Experimentation will be required to find out what fields do what.

You can attempt to hot reload CDOs via the button on the Mod Configuration screen, or the `/CLCDOReload` chat command. *Hot reloading is a WIP feature*, and could work, have no effect, or possibly even crash you depending on the fields you are modifying.

There are no restrictions on the names for CDO JSON files.

This feature becomes even more powerful when paired with a mod of your own. For example, you can use CDO edits to change the parent class of other Materials to one you packaged with your mod, changing the appearance of anything using that material.

[WARNING]
====
Remember that CDOs need to go in the correct xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[Folder].

== Disclaimer

It's possible to do a lot of cool things with this feature, but also *cause  crashes.* On the flip side, the modifications could have *absolutely no effect whatsoever*. ContentLib simply provides the tools to allow modifying the CDO - there is no guarantee that the asset you are modifying will still work correctly after the fact.

== JSON Examples

=== Rename an Item

This renames Caterium Ingots to Gold Ingots.

This is an example of a CDO edit that works with hot reloading.

```json
{
  "Class": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/Parts/GoldIngot/Desc_GoldIngot.Desc_GoldIngot_C",
  "Edits": [
    {
      "Property": "mDisplayName",
      "Value": "Gold Ingot"
    }
  ]
}
```

=== Recipe Ingredients Quantity Change

```json
{
  "Class": "/Game/FactoryGame/Recipes/Blender/Recipe_FusedModularFrame.Recipe_FusedModularFrame_C",
  "Edits": [
    {
      "Property": "mIngredients",
      "Value": [
        {
          "ItemClass": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/Parts/ModularFrameHeavy/Desc_ModularFrameHeavy.Desc_ModularFrameHeavy_C",
          "Amount": 643
        },
        {
          "ItemClass": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/Parts/AluminumCasing/Desc_AluminumCasing.Desc_AluminumCasing_C",
          "Amount": 245
        },
        {
          "ItemClass": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/RawResources/NitrogenGas/Desc_NitrogenGas.Desc_NitrogenGas_C",
          "Amount": 123
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

=== Change Material Parent Class

```json
{
  "Class": "/Game/FactoryGame/-Shared/Material/MI_Factory_Base_01.MI_Factory_Base_01",
  "Edits": [
    {
      "Property": "Parent",
      "Value": "/AdaptingGenerators/Assets/MM_FactoryCopy.MM_FactoryCopy"
    }
  ]
}
```

== Blueprint Library

Perform your own CDO modifications directly with `UCLCDOBPFLib::GenerateCLCDOFromString` or `UCLCDOBPFLib::EditCDO`. See the `CL_CDO_Module`` blueprint asset for examples of GenerateCLCDOFromString.
