= VisualKits

_ContentLib_ introduces the concept of Visual Kits to prevent having to deal with long, verbose blueprint paths in Item definitions.

Visual Kits are automatically generated at Runtime for every pre-existing Item (including those from other mods) and can be accessed by using the ClassName of the item.

Below is an example Visual Kit that reuses properties of the base-game Water resource.

```json
{
  "Mesh": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/Parts/PackagedWater/SM_PackedWater_01.SM_PackedWater_01",
  "BigIcon": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/RawResources/Water/UI/LiquidWater_Pipe_512.LiquidWater_Pipe_512",
  "SmallIcon": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/RawResources/Water/UI/LiquidWater_Pipe_256.LiquidWater_Pipe_256",
  "FluidColor":
  {
    "r": 122,
    "g": 176,
    "b": 212,
    "a": 255
  },
  "GasColor":
  {
    "r": 122,
    "g": 176,
    "b": 212,
    "a": 255
  }
}
```

As with the Item schema, all Fields are optional.

If a Json file using this Schema is placed in the Folder `FactoryGame/Configs/ContentLib/VisualKits`, the name of this file can be used by all Item definitions, and is preferred over any existing definitions of the same name (meaning base-game visual kits will be overwritten).

If this file was named `CustomWater.json`, then the Visual Kit could be used in Item definitions via the name "CustomWater".
