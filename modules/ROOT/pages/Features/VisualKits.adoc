= VisualKits

[NOTE]
====
You can find a WIP xref:Reference/JsonSchema.adoc[JSON Schema] for Visual Kits https://github.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/tree/main/JsonSchemas[here].
====

_ContentLib_ introduces the concept of Visual Kits to prevent having to deal with long, verbose blueprint paths in Item definitions.

Visual Kits are automatically generated at Runtime for every pre-existing Item (including those from other mods) and can be accessed by using the ClassName of the item.

You can also define your own Visual Kits using JSON files. In custom visual kits, you can re-use base game content, refer to content from other mods, or (in the case of icons only) use xref:Features/Icons.adoc[Icons] that have been loaded by ContentLib.

For example, a custom kit file named `Kit_CustomWater.json` can be used in Item definitions via the name "Kit_CustomWater".

[WARNING]
====
Remember that custom Visual Kits need to go in the correct xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[Folder].
====

In order to make them easy to identify among other assets, all Visual Kit JSON files should start with the prefix `Kit_`

As with the Item schema, all Fields are optional.

== Schematic Visual Kit Example

Here is an example Visual Kit that is used in RePan to reference custom xref:Features/Icons.adoc[Icons] for use in a xref:Features/Schematics.adoc[Schematic]

```json
{
  "BigIcon": "AcidRefinery",
  "SmallIcon": "AcidRefinery"
}
```

== Item Visual Kit Example

Below is an example Visual Kit that reuses properties of the base-game Water resource.

Note that if a Solid is given fluid/gas color properties, they will have no noticeable effect.

```json
{
  "Mesh": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/Parts/PackagedWater/SM_PackedWater_01.SM_PackedWater_01",
  "BigIcon": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/RawResources/Water/UI/LiquidWater_Pipe_512.LiquidWater_Pipe_512",
  "SmallIcon": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/RawResources/Water/UI/LiquidWater_Pipe_256.LiquidWater_Pipe_256",
  "FluidColor":
  {
    "r": 122,
    "g": 176,
    "b": 212,
    "a": 255
  },
  "GasColor":
  {
    "r": 122,
    "g": 176,
    "b": 212,
    "a": 255
  }
}
```

== Visual Kit overriding

If a Json file using this Schema is placed in the Folder `FactoryGame/Configs/ContentLib/VisualKits`, the name of this file can be used by all Item definitions, and is preferred over any existing definitions of the same name (meaning base-game visual kits will be overwritten).
