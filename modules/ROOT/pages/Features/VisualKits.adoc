= VisualKits

[NOTE]
====
You can find a xref:Reference/JsonSchema.adoc[JSON Schema] for Visual Kits https://github.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/tree/main/JsonSchemas[here].
====

All Visual Kit JSON files must start with the prefix `Kit_`.

_ContentLib_ introduces the concept of Visual Kits to prevent having to deal with long, verbose blueprint paths in Item definitions.

Visual Kits are automatically generated at Runtime for every pre-existing Item (including those from other mods) and can be accessed by using the ClassName of the item.

You can also define your own Visual Kits using JSON files. In custom visual kits, you can re-use base game content, refer to content from other mods, or (in the case of icons only) use xref:Features/Icons.adoc[Icons] that have been loaded by ContentLib.

If you want to refer to the kit of an existing item,
use its descriptor name, *with the `+_C+` suffix*,
For example, `Desc_OreGold_C` resolves to the Caterium Ore kit,
but `Desc_OreGold` resolves to the DefaultItemMesh (default)

For example, a custom kit file named `Kit_CustomWater.json` can be used in Item definitions via the name "Kit_CustomWater".

[WARNING]
====
Remember that custom Visual Kits need to go in the correct xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[Folder].

All Fields are optional.

== VisualKit Exporting

Nog previously wrote a chat command for exporting the VisualKits of all loaded items to text files.
I (Robb) have not checked if this command is still working.

You can attempt to use it via `/CLDumpVisualKits`, and it should output files to `FactoryGame/Mods/ContentLib/Configs/ItemVisualKits/DumpOutput/<KitName>.json` if it worked.

== Schematic Visual Kit Example

Here is an example Visual Kit that is used in RePan to reference custom xref:Features/Icons.adoc[Icons] for use in a xref:Features/Schematics.adoc[Schematic]

It requires that a file `AcidRefinery.png` be included in an xref:Features/Icons.adoc[Icons folder].

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_VisualKit.json",
  "BigIcon": "AcidRefinery",
  "SmallIcon": "AcidRefinery"
}
```

== Item Visual Kit Example

Below is an example Visual Kit that reuses properties of the base-game Water resource.

Note that if a Solid is given fluid/gas color properties, they will have no noticeable effect.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_VisualKit.json",
  "Mesh": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/Parts/PackagedWater/SM_PackedWater_01.SM_PackedWater_01",
  "BigIcon": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/RawResources/Water/UI/LiquidWater_Pipe_512.LiquidWater_Pipe_512",
  "SmallIcon": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/RawResources/Water/UI/LiquidWater_Pipe_256.LiquidWater_Pipe_256",
  "FluidColor":
  {
    "r": 122,
    "g": 176,
    "b": 212,
    "a": 255
  },
  "GasColor":
  {
    "r": 122,
    "g": 176,
    "b": 212,
    "a": 255
  }
}
```

== Visual Kit overriding

TODO is this functionality still around?

If a Json file using this Schema is placed in the VisualKits Folder,
the name of this file can be used by all Item definitions,
and is preferred over any existing definitions of the same name (meaning base-game visual kits will be overwritten).
