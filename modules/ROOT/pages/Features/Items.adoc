TODO

All Item JSON files must start with the prefix `Desc_`

Items auto-generate the categories used in the `Category` field for you if you specify one that doesn't exist

Auto-generated Category assets have their asset name (not the in-game name) start with `Cat_` for consistency with the base game, and identification.

You can attempt to hot reload Items via the button on the Mod Configuration screen, or the `/CLItemReload` chat command. Hot reloading is a WIP feature.
