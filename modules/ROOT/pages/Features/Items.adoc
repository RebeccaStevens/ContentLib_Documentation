= Items

[NOTE]
====
You can find a xref:Reference/JsonSchema.adoc[JSON Schema] for Items https://github.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/tree/main/JsonSchemas[here].
====

In Satisfactory, items, fluids, gases, and some of the properties of buildings and equipment
are represented by FGItemDescriptors, which ContentLib refers to as Items.

All custom item JSON files must start with the prefix `Desc_`.
Learn how to make them on the xref:Tutorials/CreateItem.adoc[Create an Item Tutorial] page.

If you specify a value in the `Category` field that doesn't exist yet,
ContentLib will auto-generate a new category for you.
Auto-generated Category assets have their asset name (not the in-game name)
start with `Cat_` for consistency with the base game, and identification.

You can attempt to hot reload Items via the button on the Mod Configuration screen, or the `/CLItemReload` chat command. Hot reloading is a WIP feature.

Due to a base-game bug/feature, schematics and items without assigned categories are usually not displayed in menus unless they are explicitly searched for.
You can use this behavior to hide the recipes for items from display in machines.
