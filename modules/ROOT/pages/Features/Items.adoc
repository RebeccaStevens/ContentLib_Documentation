Consider checking out the xref:Tutorials/CreateItem.adoc[Creating an Item Tutorial] after reading this page.

In Satisfactory, (solid) items, fluids, gases, and some of the properties of buildings and equipment
are represented by FGItemDescriptors, which ContentLib refers to as **Items**.

== Requirements

- All custom item JSON files must start with the prefix `Desc_`
- Remember that custom Items need to go in the correct xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[Folder].
- Items must be produced by at least one unlocked recipe to be obtainable without cheats
- Although items don't _require_ a `Name`, you basically always want to give them one
- Although items don't _require_ a `Category`, you basically always want to give them one
    (read more in 'Notable Features')
- Items will default to the `Form` of `Invalid` if you don't specify one

== Notable Features

Be sure to check out the tooltips of fields in the https://github.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/tree/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Item.json[item json schema] to learn about what options are available.

Due to a base-game bug/feature, schematics and items without assigned categories are usually not displayed in menus unless they are explicitly searched for.
You can use this behavior to hide the recipes for items from display in machines.

If you specify a value in the `Category` field that doesn't exist yet,
ContentLib will auto-generate a new category for you.
Auto-generated Category assets have their asset name (not the in-game name)
start with `Cat_` for consistency with the base game, and identification.

Items get their icon and mesh from their associated xref:Features/VisualKits.adoc[Visual Kit].

You can attempt to hot reload Items via the button on the Mod Configuration screen, or the `/CLItemReload` chat command.
Hot reloading is an experimental feature and it may not work properly.
