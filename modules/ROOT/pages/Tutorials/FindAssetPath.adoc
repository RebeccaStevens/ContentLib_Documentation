= Finding Assets

TODO

For a number of fields, you can type a friendly name of what you want to refer to,
and ContentLib will try to resolve it for you. xref:BackgroundInfo/AutomaticNameResolving.adoc[Automatic Name Resolving]

However, if you want to make a xref:Features/Patching.adoc[Patch],
you will need to know the full path of the asset you're patching so that ContentLib knows what to modify.
See the Patching page for more info as to why.

You can find this blueprint path from a https://github.com/Goz3rr/SatisfactorySaveEditor/blob/master/Reference%20Materials/[reference list],
via a tool like https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel[UModel],
or by looking a mod's source code (either online or ingame with xref:Tutorials/ContentInspector.adoc[ContentInspector]).
