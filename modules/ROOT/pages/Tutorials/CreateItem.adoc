= Creating an Item

Creating a new item is simple, as long as you're fine with re-using meshes.
This example will cover making a new item that looks like Leaves with no special properties.

Make sure to follow the
xref:Tutorials/Setup.adoc[Setting Up]
tutorial first!

In order to write your own Items, you will need the following:

* If you want to _re-use existing (modded or vanilla) item icons and meshes_, the internal name of the item whose Visual Kit you want to re-use.
* If you want to use your own _icons_, PNG images for the icons.
* If you want to use your own _meshes_, an packaged mod with those files contained within (the reasoning for this is explained further down).
* A way to define a recipe for obtaining your item, usually a ContentLib Recipe.

== Custom Item Example

Below is an example of a freshly created Item and a screenshot of it within the game.
We'll use it as a template to make our own item from.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Item.json",
  "$comment": "Comment lines will be ignored by the mod, and are a good place to leave yourself notes.",
  "Name": "My Custom Item",
  "VisualKit": "Desc_OreGold_C",
  "Form": "Solid",
  "Description": "This is a new custom Item which re-uses the visuals of Caterium Ore!"
}
```

== Setting Up

Inside of your plugin's `ContentLib/Items/` folder,
create a new file called `Desc_DocsCustomLeaves.json`

It's important to make sure that the names of your files
do not conflict with the names of any existing assets.
If a conflict is found, it will appear in the logs, which will be discussed later.
For now, try to be unique and specific with your file names to avoid any possible conflicts.

Copy in the "Custom Item Example" JSON from above to the file.

Notice the `$schema` line at the top of what we copied in -
that tells your editor what kind of format the file will follow.

If you've set up your editor correctly, you should be able to hover over the Name field,
for example, and get a description of what it does:

image:Tutorials/Item_DescriptionHover.png[image]

Or, you can press Ctrl+Space, and your editor will suggest more fields you could add:

image:Tutorials/Item_AutoSuggest.png[image]

If you don't see these, go get a good text editor as described on the xref:Tutorials/Setup.adoc[Setting Up] page!

== Name and Description

Setting the name and description of the item is as simple as specifying the Name and Description fields.

Let's call our item "Custom Leaves",
with the description "These leaves would look great in a Plantpot of Knowledge!"

== Find the Visual Kit Name

In order to make our item look like leaves, we'll need to find the name of the Visual Kit of the base-game Leaves item.

The names of base-game Visual Kits are based on the Class Name of the item descriptor that uses it.
If you'd like, you can learn more about Visual Kits
on their xref:Features/VisualKits.adoc[respective page].

You might already be able to guess from the template what the Leaves kit name would be,
but it's not always so straightforward.

Looking at the https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Leaves[Satisfactory Wiki],
we can see in the infobox that the item's Blueprint Path is
`/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/Parts/GenericBiomass/Desc_Leaves.Desc_Leaves_C`.

This means that the name of the item's blueprint generated class,
which is used as the name of the Visual Kit, is `Desc_Leaves_C`.

ContentLib will
xref:BackgroundInfo/AutomaticNameResolving.adoc[automatically resolve]
the class name into the full asset path for you,
saving you from having to use that full path.

You can find more info on the process of tracking down class names
xref:Tutorials/FindAssetPath.adoc[here].

== Additional Properties

You might have noticed that there was another field,
'Form', specified as `Solid`.
If this field is not specified, the Item's type will default to `Invalid`,
which can't be used as a normal item.

If you're making a Liquid or Gas, be sure to read the xref:Tutorials/FluidsInfo.adoc[Fluids Info] page.

There are a lot more fields you can use that this tutorial did not discuss.
Check out the xref:Features/Items.adoc[Item] page for more info,
or examine vanilla items with
xref:Tutorials/ContentInspector.adoc[ContentInspector]
as examples.

== Get the Item In Game

At this point, you have created an item, but **there is no way to obtain it yet** - even with cheats.
See the 'More Info' section below to find out why.

Follow the xref:Tutorials/CreateRecipe.adoc[Create a Recipe]
tutorial to make one so you can obtain your item and test it out.

If you've done everything correctly,
you should be able to obtain your Item in game via an item spawning utility,
or by unlocking the recipes you defined.

== Common Errors

Make sure to read the xref:Tutorials/Troubleshooting.adoc[Troubleshooting] page.

* Nothing showing up at all in the logs
  ** Make sure your items are in the xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[correct folder].
* Item not showing up in-game
  ** Did you give your Item or Recipe a Category? If not, it will only show up when searched for.
  ** This could be the fault of the item, or the custom recipe you made to grant it. Check the logs as described on the Troubleshooting page.

== Next Steps

=== Custom Icon

If you want to use custom icons for your new item, you can create your own xref:Features/VisualKits.adoc[Visual Kit].

=== Fluids

If you're making a Liquid or Gas, be sure to read the xref:Tutorials/FluidsInfo.adoc[Fluids Info] page.

== More Info

=== Why a Recipe is Needed

====
"Why do I need to use a ContentLib Recipe so that I can obtain my item? Can't I just spawn it in?"
====

As a performance measure, an Item is generally not available in Satisfactory unless a Recipe exists to register it. When you create a new item with _ContentLib_, there are no Recipes that produce it, so the game does not know to register it as existing. Writing a recipe with a ContentLib Recipe is the simplest way to create a recipe for it. Depending on how your item spawning mod locates items, it may or may not be able to find this otherwise hidden item and register it for you.


=== Why A Packaged Mod is Needed for Custom Meshes

Unreal Engine expects materials and meshes to be in a very specific cooked format in order for use.
This preparation step is unavoidable.
The simplest way to prepare your files for usage is to package them using the same method used to package a mod.
