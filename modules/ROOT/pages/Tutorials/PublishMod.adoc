= Publish your Mod

This page covers how to publish ContentLib scripts you have created as mod for others to use.

You don't necessarily need to set up a full modding project (Unreal editor install),
but it helps a lot since it will package your mod for you,
and it will make it easier to transition to a full mod later, if you so desire.

Check out the 
xref:Tutorials/Setup.adoc[Setup document]
to set up a plugin structure for your mod files.

== Upload to SMR

You can upload your mod to Satisfactory Mod Repository for anyone to download and use.

This process is out of scope of this tutorial.
You can follow the directions in the
https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/UploadToSMR.html[main modding documentation].

Make sure your mod depends on ContentLib as described in the 
xref:Tutorials/Setup.adoc[Setup document],
or your mod won't do anything by itself!
