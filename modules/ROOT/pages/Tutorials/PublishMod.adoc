= Publish your Mod

This page directs you to the correct docs for how to publish ContentLib scripts you have created as mod for others to use.

Check out the 
xref:Tutorials/Setup.adoc[Setup document]
to set up a plugin structure for your mod files.

== Upload to SMR

If you followed the xref:Tutorials/Setup.adoc[Setup document],
your files should already be in mod format.

You can now upload your mod to Satisfactory Mod Repository for anyone to download and use.

You can follow the directions in the
https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/UploadToSMR.html[main modding documentation]
to achieve this.

Make sure your mod depends on ContentLib as described in the 
xref:Tutorials/Setup.adoc[Setup document],
or your mod won't do anything by itself!
