= JSON Schemas

TODO

The format of all ContentLib JSON definition files follows a https://json-schema.org/[JSON Schema], a helpful template that both explains the structure of the file and allows your favorite editors to automatically check your syntax for you. The schema itself is human-readable, so you can also read it to learn the supported fields.

A JSON schema is *not* a template you should copy-paste into an empty file to start off - it's a set of documentation items that editors can read as well.

You can use https://youtu.be/m30JiCuW42U[Visual Studio Code], https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/json.html#ws_json_schema_add_custom[any JetBrains editor], or more, to get automatic suggestions and see the documentation as you write. Those links go to documentation on how to set it up.
